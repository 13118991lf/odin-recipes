        <p>Cabbage rolls make winter better! They're comfort food that warms you up but traditional recipes can be high in calories. In these Low Carb Turkey Cabbage Rolls I've left out the rice and swapped out the beef and pork for lean turkey. These delicious cabbage rolls are perfect for paleo and ketogenic diets and for anyone looking for a hearty meal under 300 calories</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Wash the turkey fillet. Cut into cubes and pass through a meat grinder.</p></li>
            <li><p>Peel the onion from the husk, wash. Finely chop.</p></li>
            <li> <p>Grate the peeled carrots on a medium grater.</p></li>
            <li> <p>Transfer the onions and carrots to the pan, pour over with oil and overcook for 5 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>transfer the frying to a deep bowl, add the minced meat here. Salt, sprinkle with black pepper. Stir the filling and let it stand for a while so that all the ingredients are saturated with each other.</p></li>
            <li><p>At this time, prepare the cabbage leaves. To do this, place the head of cabbage in the microwave. It's better to take young cabbage, then the cabbage rolls will turn out more tender.</p></li>
            <li><p>Turn on the microwave at maximum power for 5-6 minutes. Remove the cabbage and begin to separate the leaves. With a sharp knife, make an incision at the base of the stalk and gently pull the leaf.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cut off the hard base of the sheet and lay it on the work surface.</p></li>
            <li> <p>Place two tablespoons of filling in the middle. The toppings may need more or less, look at the size of the sheet.</p></li>
            <li> <p>Wrap the edges of the cabbage leaf inward and fold it into an envelope.</p></li>
            <li><p>Put the prepared cabbage rolls into a bowl. I recommend using a heavy-bottomed saucepan so that the bottom cabbage rolls do not burn.</p></li>
            <li><p>Prepare the sauce - mix the tomato paste, water and salt. Mix thoroughly with a fork until smooth.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour sauce over cabbage rolls. Put the pan on a slow fire and simmer for 50-60 minutes.</p></li>
            <li> <p>Serve hot on a plate. Sprinkle with fresh herbs. Enjoy your meal!</p></li>
