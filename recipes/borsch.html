    <ol>
        <li><p>Measure the broth into a large microwave-safe bowl and microwave it for 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.</p></li>
        <li> <p>Chop the potato into a small (¼ inch) dice. Add it to the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high. Stir and then cover the pot.</p></li>
        <li> <p>Roughly chop the carrot matchsticks. Add them to the pot. Stir and cover.</p></li>
        <li><p>Chop the onion. Add it to the pot. Stir and cover.</p></li>
        <li><p>When the broth is done heating, add it to the pot along with the salt and pepper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Increase heat to high, cover and let it come to a simmer. Reduce heat to a moderate simmer.</p></li>
        <li><p>While the broth is simmering in the pot, put the frozen peas and beans in the microwave-safe bowl and heat until defrosted and warm, about 2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li> <p>While the peas and beans heat, chop the dill. Add half of it to the pot of soup. Put the rest aside for now.</p></li>
        <li> <p>Put a colander over a bowl and pour in the cans of beets. You need the liquid so do not discard it.</p></li>
        <li><p>Put the drained beets into a food processor and process until they’re in small pieces.</p></li>
        <li><p>When the potatoes in the pot are tender add the vinegar, the beets, and the beet liquid and the heated peas and beans. Heat on high until simmering.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir in the remaining dill. Taste and add more vinegar and black pepper as needed.</p></li>
